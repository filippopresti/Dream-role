🪞Upon Joining Dream Role, users will be given a short analysis taking input on their interests and skills, and will process this data to create their personalised 'recommended' page, this becomes more specified as the user engages with the website. They can also filter job search by industry, which will show a comprehensive list of all the relevant job roles, upon selecting a role, users will be guided to a simulation. Here they enter a simulation of a typical day in the life, pausing at checkpoints along the way, users will be given short tasks to complete, each increasing with difficulty throughout the simulation. Upon completion, users will be given a bronze, silver or gold medal depending on how many tasks they achieved, and will be able to rate the job role from 1 - 5 stars depending on how much they think they'll enjoy it. This data will be fed back to their profile and Dream role will adapt to your individual preferences.🪞
